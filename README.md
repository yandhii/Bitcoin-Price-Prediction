# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction
## Abstract
Cryptocurrencies are beginning to gain attention owing to the ongoing advancement of blockchain technology and the sharp increase in the price of Bitcoin. Thousands of cryptocurrencies are
now available in the decentralized finance market. Due to their unique characteristics, cryptocurrencies can be used for both payment and investing activities, and their price swings are very different from those of fiat currencies and other conventional financial instruments. Therefore, it has become a popular area of study and curiosity to forecast the price patterns of cryptocurrencies. Numerous financial professionals and academics have focused their attention on predicting the price of bitcoin. They have provided various study findings and discussed what variables affect the average cost of bitcoin and what research problems need to be addressed. In this study, the random forest model, the gradient boosting model, and a combination of the two are
empirically analyzed on time series data derived from the average price of Bitcoin from January 1, 2017, to January 10, 2022. Finally, accuracy and root mean square error are used as an indicator to evaluate each forecasting model. Comparing the experimental findings, the combined models perform better than using a single model for forecasting.
